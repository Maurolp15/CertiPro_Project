### The objective of this project is to create an application called CertiPro where professionals can upload their resume as well as any tokens and NFTs that represent certifications, awards and degrees given by schools and universities. Clients would also be able to find professionals from a list of candidates and hire them. 

### The institutions will create non-fungible tokens for the student graduating from their programs in their stremlite app. Once graduated, the NFT gets created, awarded, the physical diploma including a QR code to the digital gets printed. Lastly, the token is sent to the student’s wallet address.

### The student as a professional will create a profile on CertiPro with their personal information including a profile photo, add an Ethereum wallet, their resume and certifications to be displayed, as well as the address where the certificates are stored and view the certificates on the app.

 
### We are using Remix to create and deploy contracts, create NFT's and tokens, pinata to be able to hold images in IPF's and streamlite for the front-end applications
