### CertiPro is an application where professionals can upload their resume as well as any tokens and NFTs that represent certifications, awards and degrees given by institutions such as schools and universities. Clients would be able to find professionals from a list of candidates and hire them. 
 
### For the process is required that an accredited Institution generates the NFT certificate for the student once she/he is graduated.
 
### In the following part, there is a description of the activities and requirements of each element involved in the process:

 ### INSTITUTIONS:
 
- The institutions will create non-fungible token certificates for the graduated student in the programs using their stremlite app. 
 
 - Once graduated, the NFT is created, awarded, and the physical diploma is immediately printed out, including the date and time when the token was created, the block hash and the QR code with the ipfs address. 
 
 - Lastly, the NFT Certificate token is sent to the studentâ€™s wallet address.

### STUDENTS:
 
- The Students will send the institutions their wallet addresses that will hold the tokens for their certificates.
 
- Once the students pay and graduate from the program, the institutions will send him the token.
 
- the student will import the token using the contract address and keep it on his Metamask wallet address.
 
- The student as a professional will create a profile on CertiPro with their personal information including a profile photo, add an Ethereum wallet, their resume and certifications to be displayed, as well as the address where the certificates are stored and view the certificates on the app.
 
 
### CERTIPRO:
